# MOM Launcher
This tool was developed when I was still learning the basics of C# .NET Framework, the code is really ugly and the entire tool needs to be improved.

I started this project in **2016** as a simple *PowerShell* script to automatically change the CPU Affinity to gain more fps on *Grand Theft Auto V*, after publishing the PowerShell script on [gta5-mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/) I've seen that some people was having some problems to understand how to use the script, so I decided to make a *simple friendly GUI* using *C#* *WinForms* and slowly making the tool more complex and bigger, until now.

I don't have anymore time to continue this tool and I have decided to publish it here on GitHub to allow everyone who wants to improve it.
